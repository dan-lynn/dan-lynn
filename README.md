Hi, I'm Dan Lynn of IMI Precision Systems in Farmington, CT. My role is as a Manufacturing Automation Engineer, wherein I develop in-house automation for the site's manufacturing processes.

This GitHub profile was created by IMI's IT department for me to store and manage robot program code, user manual sources, and so on.

You can reach me at `dan.lynn@imi-precision.com`.
